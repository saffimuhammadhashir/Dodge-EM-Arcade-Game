# Dodge 'Em

*Dodge 'Em* is an action-packed game developed in C++ using SFML and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. In this game, players control a character that must avoid incoming obstacles while navigating through a dynamic environment. The game showcases efficient game mechanics, collision detection, and smooth animations, all while providing an engaging and challenging gameplay experience.


## Key Features
- **Player Control**: Players can control a character with simple keyboard inputs to move and dodge obstacles.
- **Dynamic Obstacle Generation**: Obstacles appear randomly and move towards the player, creating an unpredictable environment.
- **Collision Detection**: The game uses efficient algorithms to detect collisions between the player and obstacles.
- **Smooth Animations**: Built with SFML to provide dynamic movement and graphical effects.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: The game utilizes OOP concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation to structure the code efficiently and maintain scalability.

## Technologies Used
- **C++**: The main programming language used for the development of the game.
- **SFML**: A multimedia library that handles window creation, graphics rendering, and input management.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: The game architecture is based on OOP principles to ensure clean, modular, and reusable code.
    - **Classes**: Used to define game entities such as the player and obstacles.
    - **Inheritance & Polymorphism**: Applied to extend functionality and manage different types of obstacles.
    - **Encapsulation**: Ensures that the data and functions related to game entities are properly encapsulated.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **C++ Compiler** (GCC, Clang, MSVC)
- **SFML Library**: [SFML Installation Guide](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php)

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DodgeEm.git
    ```

2. **Install SFML**: Follow the SFML installation guide for your platform.

3. **Build the project**: Compile the project using your preferred build system (e.g., Makefile, CMake, or Visual Studio).

4. **Run the game**: After building the project, run the executable to start the game.
    ```bash
    ./DodgeEm
    ```

## Gameplay Instructions
- **Movement**: Use the arrow keys or WASD to move the player character.
- **Objective**: Dodge the incoming obstacles and avoid collisions to stay alive as long as possible.
- **Levels**: The game progressively becomes more difficult with faster and more frequent obstacles as the player survives longer.
